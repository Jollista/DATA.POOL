To quote DuPont: Kevlar ® is a heat-resistant, synthetic, lightweight fiber that delivers high tensile strength that brings improved protection and performance across a range of industries and applications.

        "name" : "Bodyweight Suit",
        "cost" : "1000",
        "desc" : "**SP:** 11 | **Armor Penalty:** None\n\nSkinsuit with impact absorbing, sintered armorgel layered in key body areas. Surprisingly, they are also breathable and quite comfortable. Besides giving you a measure of protection, a Bodyweight Suit also has a place to store your Cyberdeck and supports your Interface Plugs so they stay out of the way while you're busy brain-burning that fool who just dared to pop a Hellhound on you. Many Netrunners wear clothing over their Bodyweight Suits, but plenty don't. It's a matter of personal style. **Unlike other armor, a Bodyweight Suit isn't bought in two pieces, and must always be worn on both your body and head location**. Each location has its own SP11. When repaired, both pieces are repaired at the same time. You can't wear more than one Bodyweight Suit. **Wearing a Bodyweight Suit adds one Hardware only Option Slot to a Cyberdeck connected to it**. Hardware installed in the Bodyweight Suit cannot be accessed if the armor isn't worn and can only take up 1 Option Slot."

Metalgear® is the Dark Future equivalent of that type of armor: solid metal and plastic plates on a mesh body cover. Metalgear ® will stop almost anything, but you're going to be easier to hit than a one-legged bantha in a potho race."
