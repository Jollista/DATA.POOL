# How we use your data

We don't. In fact, there isn't even a we, it's just [one person](https://jollista.github.io/me). The only thing I keep track of is your discord id and global name so I can ensure only people who verifiably have access to the Cyberpunk RED Core Rulebook can access information in it through the bot. That's it, though. And I don't use it for anything else. Wouldn't be very punk to sell your data, would it?

So go enjoy this little treat for free!
