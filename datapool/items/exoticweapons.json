        "desc" : "An Exotic Medium Pistol. Fires paint balls, which are typically filled with paint, and thus deal no damage. If you filled the paint balls with Acid however, each Acid Paintball still deals no damage, but lowers the SP of the target's armor (worn in the location shot) by one with each successful hit. Great for trying to capture someone alive. Damage dealt by this weapon cannot cause a Critical Injury. Ammunition costs the same as for a normal Medium Pistol, even if filled with Acid."

Putting on a Battleglove and taking one off is an Action. The cost to purchase and install a Cyberarm option into the Battleglove is the same cost as doing so in a Cyberarm. Any options stored in a Cyberarm or meat arm the Battleglove is being worn over are inaccessible while the Battleglove is being worn. Cannot be concealed."

Mechanically, the flamethrower is a Shotgun that can only fire incendiary shotgun shells (ammunition cost is also the same as Incendiary Shotgun Shells), except that while your targets are ignited, until they spend an Action to put themselves out, they take 4 damage to their HP at the end of their turns. If they were already on fire, this fire effect replaces one that would deal less damage. Damage dealt by this weapon cannot cause a Critical Injury, and it cannot be used to make Aimed Shots."

A high-tech katana with a nearly transparent crystal blade. Orbital crystal reinforces its redesigned microscopically serrated edge which vibrates four thousand times a minute when its handle is gripped by a user with a correct biometric key. In the hands of a user without the correct biometric key, the blade will not vibrate, leaving it only an Excellent Quality Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. At no additional cost, any color of laser can be installed into the hilt to refract within the crystal blade, giving it a flaring neon glow. The most popular color is red."
